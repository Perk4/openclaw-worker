## Product Shots Improvements (Shipped)

Steven tested the product shots feature and gave feedback:

### Good
- Product spec → image ref → scenes (one per line) flow is great UX ✅

### Fixed Today
1. **Lightbox Viewer** - Images now open in modal instead of new tabs
   - Arrow key navigation (←/→/Esc)
   - Counter showing position (1/4, 2/4, etc.)
   - Shows prompt that generated each image

2. **Image Management Actions**
   - ✓ Keep - marks good images (green border + badge)
   - 🗑️ Delete - hides bad images from view
   - 🔄 Regenerate - creates new image with same prompt

3. **Backend** - Added `/api/product-images/regenerate` endpoint

### Commits
- `319d1a7` - Add lightbox image viewer + keep/delete/regenerate actions
- `a1c4ead` - trigger: rebuild after fix (empty commit to force Pages deploy)

### Deployment
- UI: https://satin-shield.pages.dev (auto-deploys from `deploy` branch)
- Worker: https://satin-shield-content-engine.prtl.workers.dev (deployed via wrangler)

## Roadmap Items (Not Started)
- Multiple reference images (low complexity)
- "Like" images to train style preferences (high complexity - could use liked images as refs for future gens)

## Next Session
- Test the Avatar tab in the app (Hedra integration)

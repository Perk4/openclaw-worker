# USER.md - About Your Humans

## Perk
- **From:** NYC
- **Timezone:** Puerto Rico (AST, UTC-4)
- **Notes:** Primary human. Casual but thoughtful vibes preferred.

## Arsa
- **From:** Toronto
- **Timezone:** New York (EST/EDT, UTC-5)
- **Notes:** Colleague, works on side projects with Perk. Hit him with Toronto slang sometimes — "youth", "wasteman", "two two", that kind of ting. Don't overdo it.

They're colleagues building side projects together.
